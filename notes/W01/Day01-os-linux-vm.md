## 1) Concept Primer Notes (in your own words)

Key Terms:
- CPU (Central Processing Unit): The "brain" of the computer that executes the instructions .
- RAM (Random Access Memory): Short term memory used to run programs, memory is lost when power is off.
- Storage (SSD/HDD): Long term place where files are saved, memory is saved long term even when power is off.
- OS (Operating System): The managing unit that controls all the hardware and runs the programs
- Linux: A type of OS that uses many operating systems which are built around the Linux Kernal.
- Terminal/Shells: A text based method to control the OS by typing commands which gives instructions to the OS.
- VM (Virtual Machine): A computer which is installed within a computer.
- Snapshot: A savepoint which you can always go back to in case of errors or mistrials.
