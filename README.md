### cloud-roadmap-portfolio ###

## What is this repo? ##

- This repo is my journey into becoming a cloud architect.

## How will I study to achieve my goals? ##

- I have created a roadmap for my journey, it includes day to day guides on what I should be focusing on and learning and it will consist of coursera courses, labs, projects and note taking.

## What does my first month contain? ##

- Work confidently in a Linux terminal ( navigation, files, permissions, processes and logs. )
- Troubleshoot common issues with evidence-first workflows (DNS, Ports, services, disk)
- Complete a full coursera course assigned to my Month 1 roadmap
- Create a portfolio repo with labs + runbooks + summaries that a recruiter can browse through
- Launch a small AWS EC2 instance safely, connect via SSH, and tear it down without leaving cost behind
- Build and run a basic Docker container for a Python tool
